    <h2>Traditional Mole Catching Specialist</h2>
    <p>
      At Welsh Mole Catcher, I specialize in professional mole control using traditional trapping methods. Based in the heart of the countryside, I focus on protecting farms, paddocks, and rural homes from mole damage—no poisons, no gimmicks, just results you can trust.

    <h2>Rural Pest Control Services</h2>
    <p>
      While mole catching is my main expertise, I also offer pest control for rats, mice, wasps, and squirrels—particularly where rural life meets the wild. Whether you’re dealing with pests in a barn, garden, or outbuilding, I provide a reliable, local service.
